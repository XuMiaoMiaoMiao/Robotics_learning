# Robotics_learning
## Introduction

​	As a student who is just getting started in robotics, I would like to start collecting some resources and links that in my perspective are very helpful for learning robotics, including excellent open source courses, study books, useful tools, and research on some Labs that I am interested in. I hope to continue to update these lists in my subsequent academic career.

​	I hope this will be helpful to me and others like me who are just starting out in robotics.

​	My research interests include:

- Optimal Control
- Reinforcement Learning
- Optimization-based Motion Planning
- It's still being explored ...
